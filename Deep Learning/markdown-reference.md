# My personal cheatsheet for Markdown
## Common Markdown
Most simple cheats are covered in Github [cheatsheat](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
## Math
Math symbols and equivalent special text in markdown and latex to display them. Most symbols here are displayed using the math directive by tagging the text between \$...\$. In some cases, I used Markdown's symbols directly instead of math.

| Symbol |Text | Notes |
-------|--------|-------|
$\alpha$ | \alpha| Math Alpha|
&alpha; | \&alpha| HTML alpha |
$\lambda$ |\lambda|  Lambda |
$\hat{y}$ |\hat{y}| Y hat - output, given input X to a neural net
